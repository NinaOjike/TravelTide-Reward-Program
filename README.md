# TravelTide-Reward-Program: **Assigning perks based on customer behaviour**

Each customer is different from the next, hence a single approach to dealing with different customers is a futile effort.
In todayâ€™s competitive business environment, retaining customers is as critical as acquiring new ones.
Businesses often deploy customer loyalty programs to reward repeat customers and encourage continued patronage.

This project aims to analyze important customers behaviours, define segmentations that are meaningful
and aligned with business objectives, and motivate customers to engage more frequently with the business.

We comprehensively reviewed and analyzed our users' demographics and engagement patterns. We segmented our customers into 5 groups 
via RFM Modeling (the recency of users' bookings (Flight and/or Hotel), Frequency of trips, spendings for the period under review) 
and demographics behaviour.

### Corhort:
